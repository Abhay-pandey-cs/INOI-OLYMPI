Thanks for the A2A.

Sorry for the late response.

So, the official syllabus of ZCO and INOI is the IOI syllabus though they don’t give problems that hard because otherwise very less people would even get a partial point.

So seeing the past year papers and assuming the difficulty to rise a little, I think you should cover the following topics -

Maths -

Till CBSE class 9 should be enough. But you should know basic combinatorics as well.

Data Structures -

int,long long, bool,char etc
Arrays
Strings
Vectors
Map
Stacks
Queues
Deque
Set
Heaps and Priority_Queues
Pair
Linked List
Graphs
Algorithms -

First of all you should know ad-hoc problems, implementation.
Algorithm Analysis - The Big O notation, Complexity Classes
Recursion,Backtracking
Binary Search
Sorting Algorithms -
O(n^2) - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
O(n log n) - Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort
Brute-force
Greedy
Prefix sums and Sliding Window Algorithms
Dynamic Programmic -
LCS(longest common subsequence)
LIS(longest increasing subsequence)
Edit Distance
Subset-sum problem
0–1 Knapsack
Best path in a matrix
Graphs -
Representation
Traveresing - DFS,BFS
Shortest-path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
Topological Sort, Longest path in a DAG
Besides this I would like you to learn some additional topics which might come handy-

Seive of Erathosthenes
Segmented Seive
Minimum Spanning Tree
Bitmasking
Standard template library of c++
Bipartite Graphs
Multi-Dimensional DP
Ternary Search
For ZCO, all the topics except for graphs will come. Also, in ZCO, the level of difficulty will be less.

Feel free to tell me additional topics for INOI and I will add them.

Also the full IOI syllabus is - http://ioi2017.org/files/ioi-syllabus-2017.pdf

And make sure to practice lots of problems and specially ZCO and INOI ones.

Best of Luck!!!

Hope that helped.
